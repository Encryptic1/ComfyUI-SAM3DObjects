# Example Workflows

This directory will contain example ComfyUI workflow JSON files demonstrating how to use the SAM3DObjects nodes.

## Planned Examples

- `basic_generation.json` - Simple image to 3D workflow
- `rgba_workflow.json` - RGBA image input workflow
- `batch_processing.json` - Batch processing multiple objects
- `with_visualization.json` - Complete workflow with 3D preview

## Usage

To use an example workflow:
1. Open ComfyUI
2. Load the workflow JSON file
3. Connect your own images/masks
4. Run the workflow

Example workflows will be added in future updates.
